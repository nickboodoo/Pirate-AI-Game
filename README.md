# Pirate AI Game

For this project I wanted to learn more about neural networks and to do that I decided to make a maze/puzzle type game and have an AI traverse the levels. This was written in python in jupyter notebooks. Before I became a software engineer, I was a forensics scientist and I was always fascinated by neuorology and the concept of neural networks, so I had a lot of fun working on this project.
