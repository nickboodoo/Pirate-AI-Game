Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Project 2 had the Keras and dependent libraries for the neural network. I had to create each episode, epoch loop, and other facets of the nerural network. I also had to ensure that the win/loss states were favorable.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists work to create solutions that are efficient and effective. It matters because this is a growing field and eerything that we do builds on itself and becomes more and more complex. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problem solving by first identifying the problem. After I identify the problem, I can begine to work on efficient solutions to the problem. This is when I can also consider ethical issues with my solution and try to work them out. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It is my responsibility to protect people's data when it comes into my contact. I need to ensure that I am creating secure programs that will not jeopardize data.
